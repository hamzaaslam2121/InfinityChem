# InfinityChem for Minecraft 1.16.5

## Premise
InfinityChem is an Open-Source, simple, yet diverse mod that adds fun new items in multiple categories such as tech and power generation using various elements from the beloved periodic table.
The mod will be continuously updated to the best of my free availability.

## Updates
Currently adds various new armour and weapons.

Please do have experiment and have fun with these.

Unfortunately, InfinityChem as of right now is unstable, however please do try it out and let me know of any suggestions with regards to anything (balancing or new items/blocks). Some textures appear to not work, and some have simply not been made as of yet. I am very amature at graphic design with practically 0 experience and which way to go about this. If you have any tips, be sure to send them my way!

 *Current roadmap* : JEI integration, power generation (Forge Energy FE generation via generator using given metal ores and water), better ore generation.

This is a long-term project so I hope with some patience and defintley alot of hard work, the community surrounding InfinityChem will grow exponentially.
